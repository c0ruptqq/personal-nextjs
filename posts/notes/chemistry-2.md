## Amount of substance and Mole

mol - amount of substance, equivalent to the number of elementary entities in a substance

1 mole of any substance is $6.023 *10^{23}$ atoms.
Sometimes, the symbol $N_A$ is used to symbolise mole.

### Molar Mass (M)

Mass per moles of a substance ($g mol^-1$)

$n=\frac m M$

$mol=\frac {Mass} {Molar Mass}$

### Determining formulae

Molecular formula = formula showing number and types of atoms present in a molecule.

Empirical - simplest possible molecular formula, shows ratio of atoms in molecules.

## Electron Structure

Orbitals - Shells are made up of orbitals, an orbital holds two electrons with opposite spins. There are four types of orbitals (s-,p-,d-,f-), each orbital is a different shape.

Shell number = n

s-orbitals:
- shape of a sphere 
- each shell contains one s-orbitals
- the greater the _n_, the greater the radius of the s-orbital

p-orbitals:
- shape of a dumbbell 
- each shell from n=2 contains three p-orbitals ($\ce{P_{x`}}, \ce{P_{y`}},\ce{P_z}$ )

d- and f-orbitals:
- Shells from n=3 contain five d-orbitals
- Shells from n=4 contain seven f-orbitals

For easier classification each shell is split into sub-shells

Eg. 

n=1, 1s

n=2, 2s+2p

n=3, 3s+3p+3d

Within each shell each different sub-shell has different energy level, they are in the order: s,p,d,f. The sub-shells are filled according to their sub-shell energy levels. Within an orbital electrons have opposite spins (either up of down). Within a sub-shell orbitals have the same energy level, so one electron occupies each orbital before pairing withing orbitals start. 



## Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonding - strong electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and nuclei of a bonded atom.

A covalent bond is localised, acting only on a shared pair of electron between two atoms, this forms a molecule.

Dot and cross diagrams are used to display covalent bonds.

Paired electrons that are not shared (double blue balls) are called lone pairs.
