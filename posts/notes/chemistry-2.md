# Chem

## Amount of substance and Mole

mol - amount of substance, equivalent to the number of elementary entities in a substance

1 mole of any substance is $6.023 *10^{23}$ atoms.
Sometimes, the symbol $N_A$ is used to symbolise mole.

### Molar Mass (M)

Mass per moles of a substance ($g mol^-1$)

$n=\frac m M$

$mol=\frac {Mass} {Molar Mass}$

### Determining formulae

Molecular formula = formula showing number and types of atoms present in a molecule.

Empirical - simplest possible molecular formula, shows ratio of atoms in molecules.

## Electron Structure

Orbitals - Shells are made up of orbitals, an orbital holds two electrons with opposite spins. There are four types of orbitals (s-,p-,d-,f-), each orbital is a different shape.

Shell number = n

s-orbitals:
- shape of a sphere 
- each shell contains one s-orbitals
- the greater the _n_, the greater the radius of the s-orbital

p-orbitals:
- shape of a dumbbell 
- each shell from n=2 contains three p-orbitals ($\ce{P_{x}}, \ce{P_{y}},\ce{P_z}$ )

d- and f-orbitals:
- Shells from n=3 contain five d-orbitals
- Shells from n=4 contain seven f-orbitals

For easier classification each shell is split into sub-shells

Eg. 

n=1, 1s

n=2, 2s+2p

n=3, 3s+3p+3d

Within each shell each different sub-shell has different energy level, they are in the order: s,p,d,f. The sub-shells are filled according to their sub-shell energy levels. Within an orbital electrons have opposite spins (either up of down). Within a sub-shell orbitals have the same energy level, so one electron occupies each orbital before pairing withing orbitals start. 



## Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonding - strong electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and nuclei of a bonded atom.

A covalent bond is localised, acting only on a shared pair of electron between two atoms, this forms a molecule.

Dot and cross diagrams are used to display covalent bonds.

### Single bonds

Paired electrons that are not shared (double blue balls) are called lone pairs.

### 'Excited' state

If an atom gains energy the electron can 'jump' and orbital and become unpaired, thus increasing the number of available electrons in the outer shell. 

Eg. Sulfur can have a valency(amount of outer shell electron) of 2,4 and 6, this happens as the paired electrons in 3s and 3p move into the 3d orbital:

### Multiple bonds

- Double covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between two shared pairs of electrons, most common are:

$$\ce{O=O}$$
$$\ce{C=O}$$

- Triple covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between three shared pairs of electrons, most common are:

$$\ce{N#N}$$
$$\ce{H-C#N}$$

### Dative Covalent Bonds

In a dative covalent bonds the shared pair of electrons are supplied by one atom, the shared pair used to be a __lone pair__. 

Eg. 

$$\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+}$$

The '->' in the second diagram represents that both electrons were given by nitrogen.
