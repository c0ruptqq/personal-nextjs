## Amount of substance and Mole

mol - amount of substance, equivalent to the number of elementary entities in a substance

1 mole of any substance is $6.023 *10^{23}$ atoms.
Sometimes, the symbol $N_A$ is used to symbolise mole.

### Molar Mass (M)

Mass per moles of a substance ($g mol^-1$)

$n=\frac m M$

$mol=\frac {Mass} {Molar Mass}$

### Determining formulae

Molecular formula = formula showing number and types of atoms present in a molecule.

Empirical - simplest possible molecular formula, shows ratio of atoms in molecules.

## Atoms, Ions and Compounds

The mass of an electron is $\frac 1 {1836}$

Isotopes are atoms of an element with a different number of neutrons.

Relative atomic mass - Ar is the weighted mean mass of an element compared with one-twelfth of the mass of one atom of carbon-12

Relative isotopic mass - mass of an atom of an isotope compared with one-twelfth of the mass of an atom of carbon-12

Why carbon 12:
- The isotope of carbon-12 is exactly 12 atomic mass units ($12u$)
- The standard mass for atomic mass is 1 $u$ ($\frac 1 {12}$ of carbon-12) 
- 1 $u$ is approximately the mass of a proton


Relative atomic mass:

$\frac {\text{abundance*atomic mass}} {100}$

### Spectrometry 

Mass spectrometry allows us to work out relative atomic mass of an element

Basic principle:
- A sample is placed in the mass spectrometer
- The sample is vaporised and then ionised to form positive Ions
- The ions are accelerated. Heavier ions move more slowly and are more difficult to deflect than lighter ions, so the ions of each isotopes are separated.
- The ions are detected on a mass spectrum as a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 
$${\frac m z} = {\frac {\text{relative mass of ion}} {\text{relative charge of ion}}}$$

### Ions

For most elements the group numbers show the charge of the elements in that group. However, there are exceptions:

- Copper - copper(I), $Cu^+$, and copper (II), $Cu^{2+}$
- Iron - iron(II), $Fe^{2+}$, and iron(III), $Fe^{3+}$

Some good Ions to remember:
