## Conservation of Energy
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- Energy is transferred from on form to another
- energy is what is needed to do:
  - Movement
  - Changing shape
  - Changing temp
## Work
work = Force x distance (displacement)

To find the area under the graph (kinetic energy):
$$\int_0^s Fds$$
$$= \int_0^s mads$$
$$= m \int_0^s ads$$
$$= m \int_0^s \frac {dv} {dt} ds$$
$$= m \int_{v_1}^{v_2} \frac {dv} {dt} ds$$
$$= m \int_{v_1}^{v_2} vds$$
$$= m[\frac 1 2v^2]^{v_2}_0$$
$$= \frac 1 2 mv^2$$

## Spring System

Energy is stores as elastic potential

Hookes's Law:
$$F =kx$$

to find the elastic potential energy
$$\int_0^x Fdx$$
$$= \int_0^x kxdx$$
$$= k\int_0^x xdx$$
$$= k[\frac 1 2 x^2]^x_0$$
$$= \frac 1 2 kx^2$$

## Grav potential:

![graph](/img/phys/24.jpeg) 

To find GPE:
$$W.D = F*d$$
$$= F*\Delta h$$
$$= mg \Delta h$$

## Kinetic Energy:
$$E_k = \frac 1 2 mv^2$$

## Energy Conversions:
#### Pendulum

Due to a change in height there is a change in GPE. When n=0, $E_k = 0$. When pendulum is at $h_2$, $E_k = max$
 [Add pendulum drawing]
 
By knowing $V_{max} \text{, }h_1$ can be found:
$$E_k (max) -> E_{GP} = mgh$$

#### Roller Coaster
[Add drawing]

@ top  $E_{GP} = max = mgh$

@ h=0 $E_k=max$
$$\therefore E_kmax=E_{GP}max$$

## Power
$$\text{Power} = \frac {\text{Energy}} {\text{Time}}$$
Power is the rate of energy transfer 
$$P = \frac {dE} {dt} = \frac {dW} {dt}$$
$$\therefore P= \frac {W.D} t$$

## Engine power

[Add didagram]

$$P = \frac {dW} {dt} = \frac {dFs} {dt} = F \frac {ds} {ds}$$
$$\therefore P = Fv$$
Where 'F' is not the resltant force, it is the force the engine is prviding.
$$\therefore P_{engine} = F_{engine} * V$$


Motive power = Output power - Lost power due to resistive forces
$$\therefore \text{Motive power} = \frac {dW} {dt} - \frac {dE_t} {dt}$$
$$\text{Motive power} = \frac {dE_k} {dt} - \frac {dE_{wasted}} {dt}$$

## Effeciency
Useful Energy - Energy transferred for purpose 
Wasted Energy - Energy transferred not for purpose

$$\therefore \text{Effeciency} = \frac {Useful energy} {Total Energy}$$
