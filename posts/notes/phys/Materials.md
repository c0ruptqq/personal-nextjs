Density [$kgm^-3$] = $\frac {\text{Mass} [kg]} {\text{Volume}[m^-3]}$

$$\rho = \frac m v$$

Desnity is a measure of how compact the particles of a material are. Where particles are atoms or molecules.

## Volumes 

- Cube - $V_{cube} = wlh$
- Cylinder - $V_{cylinder} = \Pi r^2h$
- Sphere - $V_{sphere} = \frac 4 3 \Pi r^3$

To measure shape:
- Irregular object - Using the displacement method
- Regular object - Using a ruler
#### Displacement method
Fill a eureka can with water to the brim submerge the object and measure the displacement amount of water using a mass balance.
