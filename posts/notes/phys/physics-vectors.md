### Scales and Vectors 

Mechanics:
- Motion 
- Statics

Vector - a magnitude (value) *and* a direction

Scalar - only a magnitude

| Scalar  | Vector   |
|-------------- | -------------- | 
| Mass     | Velocity     
| Energy | Displacement     
| Distance | Force     
| Speed | Acceleration 
|  | Weight 

Scalar * Vector = Vector

g - `grav`-field strength

grav -> acceleration

vector * vector

eg. Work done = Force x Displacement <- (parallel) also known as 'dot product'

eg. Moment = Force x Displacement <- (perpendicular)
also known as 'cross-product'

If the two vectors multiplied are *parallel*, the product is a scalar. If they are *perpendicular* the product is a vector.

#### Cross products and dot products

Dot: W.D = F · S = ||F|| ||S||cos Ø

Cross: F x S = ||F|| ||S||sin Ø

Ø = angle between F and S

## Combining Vectors
To find the resultant force of 2 vectors add together $\sum F_{hor}$ and $\sum F_{perp}$ of thw two vectors. This can also be expressed in the following way:

$\vec{F}=F_x(\hat{x})+F_y(\hat{y})$

Where $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ are pure direction

### The concept of Forces

Newton's First Law - A body will remain stationary or move at a constant velocity unless acted on by a force

Newton's Second Law - The acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to the mass

$a \propto F$

$a \propto {\frac 1 m}$

Newton's Third Law - when a body exerts force on a second body, the second body experiences an equal and opposite force

### Forces in equilibrium

**Horizontal - $\theta = 0$**
If the center of mass is in the center of the object, we are assuming there is an even distribution of mass -> constant density

![d](/img/phys/6.jpg) 

$F_R$ = Restoring force or the Normal force

$F_R=F_W$

The body is in equilibrium as there is no resultant force in any direction.

**Slanted plane - $\theta > 0$**

In blue are the imaginary forces which are there to assist calculation.

${F_{FrII}} = F_{Fr}$

${F_{RI}} = F_{FR}$

$F_{wII}$ is _parallel_ to $F_{II}$


## Statics to Motion

### Galilean equation:

Scalar: 
$$\text{speed}=\frac {\text{distance}} {\text{time}}$$

Vector: 
$$\text{velocity}=\frac {\text{displacement}} {\text{time}}$$

$$V \text{[m/s]}=\frac {s \text{[m]}} {t \text{[s]}}$$

### Speed/Velocity change

$$\text{average speed}=\frac {\text{total distance}} {\text{time}}$$

$$v=\frac {\Delta s} {\Delta t} = \frac {s_2 - s_1} {t_2 - t_1}$$

Using differentiation:

$$\text{essence of change} = \frac {\text{infinitely small distance}} {\text{infinitely small time}}$$

So the differentiated equation for velocity would be:
$$v=\frac {ds} {dt}$$

### Distance and time graphs

$$y = mx+c$$
$$s = mt+c$$
Where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the y(s)-intercept

$\therefore$ when c = 0
$$s=mt$$
$$m = \frac s t$$

### Acceleration

In physics, when change is present it is final - initial values

$$a= \frac {v-u} {t}$$
Where $v$ is final velocity and $u$ is the initial velocity

In differential form:

$$a=\frac {dv} {df}$$

![acceleration](/img/phys/12.jpg)

From the graph follows:
$$ a = \frac {\Delta v} {\Delta t} = \frac {dv} {dt}$$

Acceleration can also be obtained through double differentiation:

As:
$$v=\frac {ds} {dt}$$
And: 
$$a=\frac {dv} {dt}$$
$$\therefore a=\frac {d} {dt}(\frac {ds} {dt}) = \frac {d^2s} {df^2}$$
