# Statistics

## Population and samples 

Population - a whole set of items 

**Population** mean is $\mu$ (mu) and a sample mean is $\bar{X}$ (x-bar). The data collected is called raw data/ A census is a way of collecting population data.

Sample - a selection of the population, a subset that is generated from sampling

**Sample** size needs to be large enough to validate the statistics as representative of the population. Individual units are known as **sampling units**. Sampling frames are a list of numbered sampling units.

| |Advantages | Disadvantaged |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|Census |- It should give a completely accurate result | <ul><li>Time consuming and expensive</li><li>Cannot be used when testing process destroys the item</li> <li>Hard to process large quantity of data</li></ul> |
| Sample | <ul><li> Less time consuming and expensive tha a census</li> <li>Fewer people have to respond</li> <li>Less data to process than in a census</li></ul>|<ul><li>The data may not be as accurate</li> <li>The sample may not be large enough to give information about small sub-groups of the population</li></ul> |

### Types of data

Quantitative data - Numerical data

Qualitative data - Non-numerical data

Within quantitative data variables are either:
- Discrete - the variable can only take a specific value. Eg. shoe size
- Continuous - the variable can take any value in a given range, Eg. length, 16:06

Data is usually presented in a list, frequency table or a grouped frequency table. Groups within are called **classes**

Eg. 
| Weight (nearest kg)   | Frequency    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 30-34   | 4   |
| 35-39   | 5   |
| 40-45   | 8   |

"30-34"
> 30 is the lower **limit**

> 34 is the upper **limit**

If it was written as $29.5\le w < 34.5$

> 29.5 is the lower **boundary** 

> 34.5 is the upper **boundary**

To calculate:

- Midpoint: $\frac {lower + upper limit (or boundary)} {2}$
- Class width: upper - lower **boundary**
