# Measurements and errors

### 1.1 SI units and prefixes

SI (international system) is a common unit system that is used across the globe. The SI unit system has 7 fundamental (base) units. All other units are derived.

| Quantity    | SI units    | SI symbol    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Mass    | Kilogram    | Kg    |
| Length    | Meters    | m    |
| Time    | Seconds| s     |
| Current    | Ampere | A     |
| Amount of substance    | Mole | mol     |
| Absolute temp | Kelvin | K     |
| Luminous Intensity| Candella | Cal     |

Examples:
1) Express newtons in fundamental units
   - F= m x a 
   - units: N = kg x m/s^2 =
   - = kg x ms^-2 <- Exponent form needed for full marks
2) Joules:
   - 123

### Estimation and power of ten

Estimation is a technique that is used to quickly find numerical solutions, questions using estimation are called **fermi** questions 

Estimation is often used for questions that depend on the process.

Only powers of ten are used Eg. $10^2, 10^3$

| Prefix | Abbreviation | Value      |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| peta   | P            | $10^{15}$  |
| tera   | T            | $10^{12}$  |
| giga   | G            | $10^{9}$   |
| mega   | M            | $10^{6}$   |
| kilo   | k            | $10^{3}$   |
| hecto  | h            | $10^{2}$   |
| deca   | da           | $10^{1}$   |
| deci   | d            | $10^{-1}$  |
| centi  | c            | $10^{-2}$  |
| milli  | m            | $10^{-3}$  |
| micro  | $\mu$       | $10^{-6}$  |
| nano   | n            | $10^{-9}$  |
| pico   | p            | $10^{-12}$ |
| femto  | f            | $10^{-15}$ |

## Limitations of Physical Measurements

Errors are unavoidable. They can be divided into two types:
- random
- Systematic

A random error is one that varies and is likely to be positive or negative (two-sided error)

A systematic error is one which is constant throughout a set of readings (usually one-sided)

To be precise - to be consistent
To be accurate - be close to the true vale


## Uncertainty

The uncertainty on repeated readings can be calculated using $\pm \frac {\text{range}} {2}$

A value should be presented as $\text{mean} \pm \text{absolute uncertainty}$ or $\text{mean} \pm \text{relative uncertainty}$

For analogue scales uncertainty is divided by 2. For digital it is not.

### Addition/subtraction

$(a+b)\pm(\Delta a + \Delta b)$

When adding / subtracting quantities: add the **absolute** uncertainties together

### Multiplication/division

$(a*b)\pm((\Delta a/a + \Delta b/b) * 100)$

When multiplying quantities, add the **percentage** uncertainties

### Raising to a power

$a^x \pm (x * (\Delta a/a)*100%)$

When raising to a power, multiply the exponent value by the percentage uncertainty

# Electricity

### Revision 

In a circuit:

__Ammeter__
- Ideally has zero resistance
- Measures amps (A)

__Voltmeter__
- Ideally has infinite resistance
- Measures potential difference (V)

__Definitions__
- Current (I) - rate of flow of charge
$$\text{charge}=\frac {\Delta Q} {\Delta T}=\frac {\text{coulombs (C)}} {\text{seconds (S)}}$$

- Charge of an electron - $1.6x10^{-19}C$
- Potential difference (V)
$$V=\frac W Q=JC^{-1}$$
Where "W" is work done

Eg. Electrical energy (Joules)

$$W=IV\Delta{t}$$

- Power - rate at which work is done 

Eg. Electrical power (Watts)

$$P=IV$$

$$P=\frac {W}{\Delta T}=\frac{IV\Delta{T}}{\Delta{T}}=IV$$

- Electrical resistance (R)

$$R=\frac{V}{I}$$
Where R is in ohms ($\Omega$), the above equation is also know as Ohm's Law
