Group two elements are called alkaline earth metals. Naturally, the elements are only found in stable compounds -- never on their own.

Group two elements have 2 electrons in their outer shell, two in the s sub-shell. Redox reactions are the most common type of reaction group 2 elements react in. In these reactions the group 2 element if oxidised and acts as a _reducing agent_. 

$$\ce{Ca -> Ca^{2+} +2e-}$$

### Reactions with oxygen
When reacting with oxygen the general formula for the product will be $\ce{MO}$, M being the group 2 element.

$$\ce{2Ca_{(s)} + O2_{(s)} -> 2CaO}$$
$$\ce{2Mg -4e- -> 2Mg^{2+}}$$
$$\ce{2O + 4e -> 2O^{2-}}$$

### Reaction with water
When reacting with water the general formula for the product is $\ce{M(OH)2 + H2}$
$$\ce{Sr_{(s)} + 2H2O_{(l)} -> Sr(OH)2_{(aq)} + H2_{(g)}}$$
$$\ce{Sr - 2e- -> Sr^{2+}}$$
$$\ce{2H + 2e- -> 2H-}$$

### Reactions with dilute acids
The general formula for the reaction with dilute acids is:
$$\text{M + acid -> salt + hydrogen}$$
Eg.
$$\ce{Mg_{(s)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} -> MgCl2_{(aq)} + H2_{(g)}}$$
$$\ce{Mg - 2e- -> Mg^{2+}}$$
$$\ce{2H + 2e- -> 2H-}$$

Down the group the elements become more and more reactive, as the nuclear attraction to the outer electron shell decreases due to an increase in atomic radius and electron shielding.

### Group 2 oxides

When reacting with water group 2 oxides release $\ce{OH-}$ ions, forming an alkaline solution of the metal hydroxide. Group 2 _hydroxides_ are only slightly soluble in water. When the solution become saturated the hydroxide and metal ions will form a solid.

$$\ce{CaO_{(s)} + H2O_{(l)} -> Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2OH^-_{(aq)}}$$
$$\ce{Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2OH-_{(aq)} -> Ca(OH)2_{(s)}}$$

The solubility of the hydroxides in water increases down the group, so the  resulting solutions contain more $\ce{OH-_{(aq)}}$ ions and are more alkaline.

Summary Questions:

1. Group 2 metals donate electron to other elements in the reaction
2. a) $\ce{Mg - 2e- -> Mg^{2+}}$ and $\ce{2H+ +2e- -> H2}$ b) Mg oxidised H reduced
3. Down the group the electron radius and electron shielding increase, decreasing nuclear attraction, making it easier to remove electron from the outer shell.
4. Group 2 oxdies react with water, forming metal hydroxides. Those ions dictate alkalinity. Down the group solubility of metal hydroxides increases, increasing alkalinity.
