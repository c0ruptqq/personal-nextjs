Electronegativity - ability of a nuclei to pull a pair of electrons towards itself within a covalent bond.

Eg

$$\ce{H^{\delta+}\bond{-}O^{\delta-}}$$
In which $\delta$ represents partial charge.

Electronegativity depends on two factors:
- Atomic radius - As the radius increases, electronegatitivity decreases
- Number of protons (unshielded electrons)[^1] - The higher the number of protons the higher the attraction

[^1]: Full electron shells shields the nucleus reducing electronegativity.

Thus:

$$\therefore N,O, F \text{ and } Cl \text{ have the highest electronegativity}$$

### Molecules and polarity

Molecules containing polar bonds are not always polar. Non-polar molecules have bonds that are usually arranged symmetrically (Eg. $\ce{CO2}$). While polar molecules have bonds that are arranged in an asymmetric fashion.
