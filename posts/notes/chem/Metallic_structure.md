Lattice - a regular, repeating arrangement


Metallic bonding is a special type of bonding. It is the strong electrostatic attraction between cations and delocalised electrons. In a solid structure each atom donates its outer shell of electrons into a shared pool, these are called _delocalised electrons_. The delocalised electrons sit between metal cations fixing them into position. The resulting structure is called a _giant metallic structure_.
- Cations are fixed in place
- Delocalised electrons are mobile and are able to thus transfer charge

## Properties of metals

- Strong metallic bonds
- High electrical conductivity -- When voltage is applied across a metal the delocalised electrons move through the structure carrying charge.
- High melting and boiling points -- A lot of energy is needed to over come the _electrostatic attraction_ between the cations and electrons.
- Metals do not dissolve -- When there are any interactions between polar solvents and charges in the metallic lattice a reaction occurs instead.

# Giant covalent structures

Boron, carbon and silicon form a lattice structure. The atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds in a network forming a _giant covalent lattice_. Both silicon and carbon (in a diamond form) use all four electrons to form bonds, and are thus in a tetrahedral structure. While in graphite the fourth electron is delocalised and is used to hold the layers of hexagonal carbon arrangements together. 

## Properties

- High melting & Boiling points -- High amounts of energy are needed to overcome the strong covalent bonds.
- Insoluble - The covalent bonds inside the lattice are too strong to be broken by solvents.
- Conductivity - Only graphite and graphene (a single layer of graphite) conduct electricity as they form structures with delocalised electrons

# Melting points

The sharp drops in melting points mark the transition from giant structures to simple molecules.
