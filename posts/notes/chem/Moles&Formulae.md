mol - amount of substance, equivalent to the number of elementary entities in a substance

1 mole of any substance is $6.023 *10^{23}$ atoms.
Sometimes, the symbol $N_A$ is used to symbolise mole.

### Molar Mass (M)

Mass per moles of a substance ($g mol^-1$)

$n=\frac m M$

$mol=\frac {Mass} {Molar Mass}$

### Determining formulae

Molecular formula = formula showing number and types of atoms present in a molecule.

Empirical - simplest possible molecular formula, shows ratio of atoms in molecules.
Concentration - mol $\text{dm}^{-3}$


Conversions:
- $\text{cm}^3$ -> $\text{dm}^3$ - /1000

[X] -> working out concentration

### Ideal gas formula

PV = nRT

P - Pressure in Pa

V - Volume in $m^3$

n - Moles

R - Ideal gas constant (8.31 $Jk^{-1}mol^{-1}$)

T - Temperature in kelvin

One atm (atmosphere) = 101325 Pa
